### Getting started

- Log into your EyePop account at https://dashboard.eyepop.ai/sign-in
- Create an **API Pop**
- After creating your pop, create or copy your API Key into the config.js file, as well as the Pop's UUID. If token is left empty, you will be navigated to an authentication workflow.

### Need a Web Server locally to test?

- Easiest: [Web based IDE](https://replit.com/)
- Option 1) Python: `python3 -m http.server 9001`
- Option 2) [LiveServer Extension to VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Start your web server from within the **_parent_** directory and open an html file found in this directory.

## Overview

Gesture Detection here is done by measuring distances between the 3D points provided by the EeyPop SDK. We loop over all prediction data, find any hand points, then organize, and compare the labeled joints to detect if a gesture is active.
It's important to note that smoothing of these points will provide a much better user experience and help filter out false-positives.
